# YOLO Object Detection Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of object detection using the powerful YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. The concepts and methods in this project are inspired by the following papers:

- [Redmon et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640)
- [Redmon and Farhadi, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242)

## Objectives
By completing this project, you will:

- Detect objects in a car detection dataset.
- Implement non-maximum suppression to enhance detection accuracy.
- Implement intersection over union (IoU) to refine bounding box predictions.
- Handle bounding boxes, a critical image annotation type in deep learning applications.

## Features
- **Object Detection**: Leverages YOLOâ€™s architecture to detect objects in images quickly and accurately.
- **Non-Maximum Suppression**: Removes redundant bounding boxes for cleaner detection results.
- **Intersection Over Union (IoU)**: Measures the overlap between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes.
- **Bounding Box Handling**: Processes and visualizes bounding boxes effectively.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- Numpy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the car detection dataset provided in the project.
2. Run the YOLO model to detect objects:
   ```bash
   python yolo_object_detection.py
   ```
3. Visualize results using the provided utilities to display images with bounding boxes.

## Code Structure
- `yolo_object_detection.py`: Main script to perform object detection.
- `utils.py`: Helper functions for bounding box processing and IoU computation.
- `nms.py`: Implementation of non-maximum suppression.
- `data/`: Contains the car detection dataset.

## How YOLO Works
YOLO divides an image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell. It is designed for speed and accuracy, making it a popular choice for real-time object detection tasks.
